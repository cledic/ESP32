Project adapted to ESP32-EYE board. 
  I have also added:

  2) Telegram /rssi command to show dBm receiving power. 
  
  3) Telegram /audio command to send 3 seconds 16KHz sampled audio, from ESP32-EYE I2S mic. The audio file is received as WAVE file.
  
  4) the ability to send photo pressing the BUTTON(15).
